Extracted NVD CVEs with commit URLs. 
Generated partial BF specifications the CVEs with assigned CWEs.

In most cases MainWeakness specifies the final exploitable weakness.
OtherWeakness elements provide possible causing chain of weaknesses to the main weakness. The last OtherWeakness consequence would be the cause for the MainWeakness.

Failures are identified by keywords from the CVE descriptions.

Some CVEs appear in more than one of the _DAT, _INP, and _MEM splits, as corresponding CWEs are asigned to them by NVD.

Next step would be to provide also the backwards possible chains from failure through final weakness (the sink) to the bug weakness (the root cause).

Further deep analysis is needed to finalize the BFCVE specifications.
